Question:
How could having easy access to entire history of a file make you a
more efficient programmer in the long term?
Answer: 
this way i can always go back and avoid fixing my bugs
everytime i create one. 
also i have complete control over my code so when ever i screw up i
can go back with one click. 
So i dont need to be afraid of testing.
