udacity git/github course notes

This is just a repository of notes which i took while taking a course online on udacity on git and github.
All files are in .txt 
editor used : emacs

Notes are very basic and may contain errors and taken on fly.
Reflections are my thoughts on concepts to again error prone.
They are on the mercy of my understanding of the concepts so anyone interested in learning should refer to textbook than relying on these notes.

Shunya.
