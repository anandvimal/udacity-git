Lesson 2

In this chapter:
git on your own machine 
for local projects.
merge branch 

Repositories:
store metadata in the directory. its hidden by default starts with
.name (.git) go in command line and do "ls -a" you can see hidden
files. 

last time when you cloned a existing repository all the metadata came
with it. 

Initilize a repository:
- git init

check for all repositories:
- git log


- git diff oldfile newfile
(otherwise it gets opposite lines removed shown as + and lines added
as -ve incase of new old (order) )
last git commit: 3884eab839af1e82c44267484cf2945a766081f3

error commit: 25ede836903881848fea811df5b687b59d962da3
before error: df035382c41b4d0cda86a1aa30b53f15bef05b53


also note that if I just do:

- git diff
it shows me difference between working directory and staging area.

if git diff --staged 
it shows me different between staging area and recent commit.

if diff commit1 commit2
well question says it all difference betwen commit1 and commit2.

- git checkout master
this takes us to most recent checkout. and with this we can keep
moving forward.

Branching:
all of a sudeen new experiment with the current project?
for example project in 2 different language.
italian and english

master branch (main branch)
-other branches.

deattached head stage: in a stage without label.

merging : process of joinging two branches.


git branch

git branch name

git checkout branchname

mode, master and coins branches. 



      	     	       		 master:

		easy mode-------fix the bug and commited
			|	(did by me as exercise)
		on easy mode 
		split into 2		

- git log			
so git log shows us a log starting from current commit going up to
parent until we reaches a commit without parent. 

something like

current
|
parent of current(b)
|
c = parent of (b)-----------//-(x) another branch (invisible in the log)
|
d = parent of c

as long as there is a parent
suppost at c there was new branch emerging called x
in this git log of current the  print of x will not be printed as its not in the path.
