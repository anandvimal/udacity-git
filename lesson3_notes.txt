Chapter 3:

Make an account on github.
Use public repositories (its free)

make a repository on github first (you can not clone directly it needs
a empty repository on github first). 

If you did not initiliased a respository on desktop then click to add
a readme so it can commit right away online. 

to send repository from your pc to github we need remotes.
remotes:
pretty much like bridges between your pc to github.
each project (folder) needs its own remote.
if you have just 1 remote name it origin (standard)
- git remote (shows all remotes)
- git remote add <name> <url>
<name> = name of remote
<url> of github repository which we initialized.

git on terminal does asked me my username and password for github.com.
//need a way to make it remember.

git remote -v
on doing git remote -v it shows us all remotes name and url (fetch and
push) which means to fetch from this origin use this url and this to
push use this.

also if the github repository is updated then need to 
git pull <remote> <branch>
remote = remote name (origin in this case)
branch = master in this case.
