Lesson 2
Reflections:

Question:What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you
need to do it?
Answer:
When we initilize a repository the git gets initialized in that
directory. And by initilizing the git it starts to track all the files
in that directory. By initilizing git gets active but there are no
commits at this stage. we need to do it when we want to create a
repository. as its the first step we need to do to track and commit
versions of out data.
