Lesson 2
Reflections:

Question:What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you
need to do it?
Answer:
When we initilize a repository the git gets initialized in that
directory. And by initilizing the git it starts to track all the files
in that directory. By initilizing git gets active but there are no
commits at this stage. we need to do it when we want to create a
repository. as its the first step we need to do to track and commit
versions of out data.

Question:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
Answer:
stagging area comes in middle of both. files which are stagged are
tracked by git but not commited(yet). when ever we commit all the
files in stagging area are saved in that current version in that
commit. 
	"in my words we can say stagging area is like a office with
	safe all important files are gathered in office and at at important
	times or event all those files in office are copied into
	safe. anything outside the office is not important and never saved."
