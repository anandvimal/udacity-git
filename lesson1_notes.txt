1 install git.

compare files 
(compare the code and tells what has changed between two versions of these.)
on windows : use FC
on mac/linux : use Diff 

use of diff:
diff -u oldfile.ext newfile.ext

* the -u makes it look more organised. without -u i was unable to
  understand at all.

note down the link about reflections.
spend some time on these reflections.
seems like a good topic.

url:
topic site:
https://sites.google.com/site/reflection4learning/Home

20 page paper on reflections: 
http://184.182.233.150/rid=1LW06D9V6-26428MK-1Z64/Mezirow's%20chapter,%20How%20Critical%20Refletion%20Triggers%20TL.pdf

another thing i can look into is note taking that topic is covered in
my physics class website. 
(i will check for it today. (yes today.)

also some books are mentioned in the reflections website. one day i
will look into those also. 

but first of all i will finish this course.

how to clone: 
git clone url

some commands of git:

- git checkout git_id_key
checkout : takes git directory to that commit state.

we copied 3 files in our home directory which i have no clue
about. there is a link in notes which explain actually what it does
and how it does it. I will like to take a look at it later. for now i
am just trying to get it in working condition.
